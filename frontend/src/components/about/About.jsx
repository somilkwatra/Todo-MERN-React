          I'm Somil Kwatra, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a focus on mobile and web development. During my internship at the Central Electricity Authority of India, I honed my skills in Node.js, React.js, PHP, and Ruby on Rails, while also gaining experience with version control systems like Git and SVN.

          Some of my projects include developing a server file management web app, a conference room booking system, and a Shopclues clone. Additionally, I've worked on practice projects like the Talk ChatGPT app, a Football app, an Instagram clone, and a Saloon web/app.
